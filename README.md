# duke-computerarchitecture
Code from Duke ECE 250: Computer Architecture taken in C/RISC-V in Fall 2020.

"This course provides you with a basic understanding of how computers work. Starting from basic number and data representation we explore how computers store and manipulate information to perform computation. This is followed by higher-level systems designs including memory and input/output. We conclude with a brief discussion of advanced topics in computer systems design.

Topics covered include: C Programming, computer systems organization, machine language and assembly programming, machine representation of data and instructions, computer arithmetic, basic logic design, the CPU and instruction interpretation, memory organization, peripherals and I/O."
